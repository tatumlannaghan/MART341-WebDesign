How are VCS useful?
VCS are useful because it allows for all changes made to a file to be documented and saved at each layer of change. If more than one person is working on a file and they want to try a different technique than someone else both can do so without altering each others work. 
Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
I would say my favorite artistic medium is video since I am a media arts student with a focus in filmmaking. I love being able to control what specifically gets shown to the viewer and being able to tell a story through it.
