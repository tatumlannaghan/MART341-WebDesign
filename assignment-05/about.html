    <p>
    Sex And The City is a TV show that started in 1998 that follows four women and their dating life in New York City.

    The show discusses a lot of topics that felt shocking to have been discussed in the 90s and early 2000s.
    There is also a shocking amount of nudity in the TV show that I thought wouldn't have been accepted.
