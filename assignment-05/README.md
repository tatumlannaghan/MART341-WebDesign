Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine. What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?

I used the Wayback Machine to view the website youtube.com. I chose to compare present day, February 21st, 2022 and May 5th, 2005 when the first snapshot is available from. The older version is a lot more clunky with its design while the new design is sleek.
