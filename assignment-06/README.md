Describe the difference between semantic and structural markup

Structural markup contains elements that provide info and help guide the user visually using lists, heading, paragraphs, and breaks.
Semantic markup adds meaning to the information by adding emphasis to words and phrases such as bolding text, quotes, citations, italics, etc.
