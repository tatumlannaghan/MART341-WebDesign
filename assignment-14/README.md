How did your user testing sessions go?
They went well. I chose my cousin who is 16 and my mom who is 51 so I could get a wide range of age in their opinions. It was a little weird to conduct the test on family members however.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
I have been looking at different shades of brown to use. I am also going to include more of the videos I've created with/for other people on the webpage.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
I am struggling with placing text where I want it exactly.
